    <h2>1.Padmanabhaswamy Temple</h2>
    <img src="richtemples.jpg" alt="temple"  height="200px">
    <p>Extant Hindu texts including the Vishnu Purana,
     <b>Brahma Purana</b> ,<b> Matsya Purana</b>, Varaha Purana</b>,<b> Skanda Purana</b>,<b>Padma Purana</b>,
    Vayu Purana and Bhagavata Purana mention the Padmanabhaswamy Temple.
    The Temple has been referred to in the (only recorded) Sangam period
    literature several times.Many conventional historians and scholars
    are of the opinion that one of the names that the Temple had,
    <strong><cite>"The Golden Temple"</cite></strong>, was in cognisance of the Temple being already 
    unimaginably wealthy by that point (early Sangam period). Many 
    extant pieces of Sangam Tamil literature and poetry as well as
    later works of the 9th century of Tamil poetsaints like Nammalwar
    refer to the temple and the city as having walls of <b>pure gold</b>. Both
    the temple and the entire city are often eulogised as being made of 
    gold, and the <b><q>temple as heaven</q></b>.</p>

    <h2>2.Badrinath Temple</h2>
    <img src="badrinath.jpg" alt="temple" height="200px">
    <p>There is no historical record about the temple, but there is
    a mention of the presiding deity Badrinath in Vedic scriptures
    . According to some accounts, the shrine 
    was worshipped in some form in the Vedic period. The architecture
    of the temple resembling that of a Buddhist vihara (temple) and the
    brightly painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads
    to the argument. Other accounts relate that it was originally established
    as a pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the ninth century. It is believed
    that Shankara resided in the place for <strong>six years</strong> from <b>CE 814 to 820</b>. He
    resided six months in <b>Badrinath</b> and the rest of the year in Kedarnath.
    Hindu followers assert that he discovered the deity of Badrinath in
    the<b> Alaknanda River</b> and enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot 
    springs. A traditional story asserts that Shankara expelled all
    the Buddhists in the region with the help of the Parmar ruler king Kanak
    Pal, however this might be fictitious and very recent. </p>
